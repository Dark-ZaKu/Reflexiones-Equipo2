-Don Norman and the way that Good Design makes you happy-

It's February 18th, 1:09 a.m., the night is partialy cloudy with 0% precipitation.
I just finished watching a video about how a good desing makes you happy from the good
old Don Norman, and let me tell you, every video i see from this gentleman it's really entertaining,
and makes you reflect a lot.

For example, he talks about how something fun makes everything better. And that's true, and it happens
to me a lot! Just think about it, some of the new upgrades that cellphones have right now is that
you can use a gif for wallpaper, and as useless as it sounds, it's still quite fun to see. And i can
talk for experience about that; I use a gif for wallpaper, my phone get's kinda laggy from time to time
and still i keep it on! And you may ask "why?"... Well, it's fun.

Also, if something is fun you may not think about it as work or something that you don't wanna do. Like, 
a lot of people enjoy using Discord form group calls and homework, even tho it's not the best when it comes
to sharing documents that weights more than 8mb... Still, a lot of people would prefer to use it over 
any other app like Skype or Slack (sorry teacher), and the reason is because it's way more pleasing to the eye,
faster and it doesn't look as serious as the other ones, and it pretty much means that people will be more prone to use it.

I could probably keep talking about it, there's a lot of points i haven't talked about, but I'm pretty sure
you're already kinda bored of me rambling about how cool this article is. So... i'll leave it here.
