                    -Can AI make/design good products?-

Former Apple VP Don Norman thinks that in fact AI's can make a good product
but we need to define what's good for us, since it may a different meaning for
each one of us.

The other day i was watching some videos on Youtube when i suddenly came across
a video called "Tory Belleci test the ultimate buger robot", basically it was 
about a guy that created a robot that could make burgers in 5 minutes, it went from
the grinding of the meat to the assembling of everything. To be honest it was really
impressive, it was so fast and you could see the quality but could the taste be as 
good?
Well, i think this could be a good example since for some people the result is good,
it was fast, had a nice flavour and could experience something different. But for other
people it won't, since it wouldn't have the "love" and care that a human could put on the
making of the same. I think the conclusion it would be that yes, they can make a good product
but they can't create a product that would bring emotions to the users, like one created by
people and i know we are not talking about if it's useful or not but i think that if we are gonna
use an AI for a mass produced product then it would be a great idea to promote this aproach, since it
would save us a lot of time and money.
