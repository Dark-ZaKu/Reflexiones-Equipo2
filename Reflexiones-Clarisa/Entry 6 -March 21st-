                                    -Emotional Design-

Lately, companies have been creating systems or products based on the fact that they think
we are logical beings when actually we are more emotional, or at least we emphasize it more
since what gives value to an object is our emotions.

There's 3 leves of emotion:
-Visceral: we are born with it.
-Behavioral: how we use something, how we learn to understan it or does it feel good?
-Reflective: the conscious level, we think back about what we did and if we liked it or not.

And i agree with Don Norman, we should have a perfect balance combining the logical and
emotional side, because that's the only way to achieve a good result. The problem is that
i don't think this is as easy as it sounds and you need way to much experience to actually 
understand all the things you need, like what level of emotion are you gonna use or technology.
