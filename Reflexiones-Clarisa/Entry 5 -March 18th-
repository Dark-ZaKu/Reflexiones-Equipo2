         -Focus on Results, Not on Perfect UX-

When it comes to a product, a lot of people believe that the user experience is the most 
important part but it actually isn't. People doesn't care about the object they're using, 
they care about the result, so we should have in mind what our users are trying to accomplish, 
how will they appreciate it or will they be happy with it? And maybe the user experience isn't 
perfect but if they get what they were expecting, everything will be fine, it only really matters 
if it gets in the way or make everything more difficult.

This is basically the opinion Don Norman had about this problem, and to be honest
i was a little baffled with it haha, since the last time i was watching a video of him,
he was talking about how important the user experience should be and that
we should create designs that attract people to our products, designs that would bring
joy and fun to our users.

I find it a little bit confusing, maybe the design is the key to a eye catching product and
the UX is everything that surrounds the proccess of obtaining said product and using it. If it 
actually is like that, then it's more logical but still i wouldn't totally agree with this idea, since
i think the experience you have with a product is really important.
Obviusly the result is the main key but how many times have we switched apps or maybe products to another brand
just because we like it more? My mom is a clear example of this logic, she had a perfectly functional cellphone
that had only a few months of use but decided to change it to an iphone that costs around 20 000 pesos.. Her reason was 
that it was prettier and easier to use. So i don't know, maybe we should give this topic a little more thought.
