                        -Personas and Interfaces (Mostly Personas)-

The last Friday we had a talk/conference with the creator of "Click", and to make it as short as possible,
He told us that the main point when it comes to innovating, is to make something that people
need. And if you think about it, most of the time, people create personas for an app/interface that 
already exists and that makes no sense since you're trying to force it.

After the talk, i started to think about my project and how are we making a change. Maybe the main idea
is correct but what about the interface? How are we going to deliver it to our users? Since that day, 
i began to think about all the personas that would benefit from this project and the possible scenes that 
could reinforce this idea.
I hope that soon (hopefully this week) as a team, we could have a solid example of who and what we need to
get this project to the next stage, since we have been laking on this particular area.
