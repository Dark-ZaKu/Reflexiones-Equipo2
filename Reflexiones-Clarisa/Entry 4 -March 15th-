                            -Am i doing the right thing?-

So this day was somewhat special to me, since quite a long time i've been feeling a bit uneasy 
when it comes to my career. What am i going to do when i graduate? Am i going to be good enough 
for any company to hire me? In 5 or 10 years, how do i see myself? 

All that i knew was that i wasn't the best when it came to programming and that a lot of my friends 
were already working on something related to our careers.The last semester i had a subject called 
"Web Apps Development" or something like that, and i remember that i finally felt like i was good on something, 
that i could explain to my friends stuff they weren't able to do and that i liked spending hours on the project we were making.

Later that semester, i received many more "signs" that i was going on the right path and 
today i cemented that idea. When i heard Mr.Hurieta talking about his job and all things related
i realised that in fact, that's what i wanted to do. Web Development, UX/UI Desing, FE Desing, that's
what i'm good at and now that i know it, i need to work hard to achieve what i want.
And as cheesy as it may sound, i now feel at ease with the path i'm taking.
