                          -Personas are the future for Enterprise Apps-

So... basically i just finished reading that article and i agree, "Personas" are indeed useful.
If you have a clear idea of who are you dealing with when it comes to creating a product/App, it 
becomes way easier, since now you know who are the customers and what do they like. To be
quite honest, while reading about this subject i also thought about how can this be useful to me, 
to my team's project, and mainly if i'll be able to create an interface good enough, even if i had
to my disponsition a persona that fits exactly what i need.

And finally, what do i need if i want to create an interface, app or product that can satisfy the
needs of two or more completely diferent personas? Is that posible?. I think i'll be making another
entry that continues with this topic, since now I'm way too involved in it.
